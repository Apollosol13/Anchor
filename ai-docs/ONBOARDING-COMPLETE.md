# Onboarding Flow Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Been Built

### 1. **Survey Screen** (`/app/onboarding/survey.tsx`)

- Beautiful 3-question onboarding survey
- Smooth progress bar
- Question 1: "What brings you to Anchor?"
- Question 2: "How often do you read the Bible?"
- Question 3: "What would help you most?"
- Saves responses to Supabase `user_onboarding` table
- Auto-advances to paywall after completion

### 2. **Hard Paywall** (`/app/onboarding/paywall.tsx`)

- Mandatory subscription/trial before app access
- Prominent "Start 7-Day Free Trial" button
- Shows 6 premium benefits with icons
- 3 pricing tiers (Weekly/Monthly/Yearly)
- Trial info banner
- No skip option (hard gate)
- Marks onboarding complete on purchase
- Redirects to main app after trial starts

### 3. **Smart Auth Flow** (`/app/_layout.tsx`)

- Checks onboarding status on login
- New users → Survey → Paywall → App
- Returning users → App directly
- Blocks access to main app without trial/subscription

### 4. **Database** (Supabase)

- `user_onboarding` table tracking:
  - Survey responses
  - Onboarding completion
  - Paywall shown timestamp
  - RLS enabled for security

## 📱 User Flow

```

   - Responses saved to database
   ↓
3. Hard Paywall

4. Main App (Full Access)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### First-Time User Journey:

1. User signs up with email/password
2. Automatically redirected to `/onboarding/survey`
3. Answers 3 quick questions
4. Survey saves to `user_onboarding` table
5. Redirected to `/onboarding/paywall`
6. MUST start trial to proceed (hard gate)
7. After trial starts, marks `has_completed_onboarding = true`
8. Redirected to `/(tabs)` - main app

### Returning User Journey:

1. User logs in
2. System checks `has_completed_onboarding`
3. If true → Direct to main app
4. If false → Back to survey/paywall flow

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Created:

- `/app/onboarding/survey.tsx` - Survey screen
- `/app/onboarding/paywall.tsx` - Hard paywall

### Files Modified:

- `/app/_layout.tsx` - Auth flow with onboarding check
- Database: `user_onboarding` table

### State Management:

- Uses existing `SubscriptionContext` for purchases
- Uses existing `AuthContext` for user
- Queries Supabase for onboarding status

### Data Saved:

```typescript
{
  user_id: string,
  primary_goal: 'daily_reading' | 'deep_study' | 'spiritual_growth' | 'share_verses',
  reading_frequency: 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'occasionally' | 'just_starting',
  help_preference: 'ai_insights' | 'reading_plans' | 'community',
  has_completed_onboarding: boolean,
  has_seen_paywall: boolean,
  survey_completed_at: timestamp,
  paywall_shown_at: timestamp
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 7-Day Trial Setup:

**In App Store Connect (when you create subscriptions):**

1. For each product (weekly/monthly/yearly)
2. Add "Introductory Offer"
3. Set to: **7 days free**
4. This is configured in Apple's system, not in code

### Trial Behavior:

- Requires payment method upfront
- User isn't charged for 7 days
- After 7 days, automatically converts to paid
- User can cancel anytime before trial ends
- RevenueCat SDK handles trial state automatically

### Hard Paywall:

- No "Continue with Free" option
- User MUST start trial to use app
- Higher commitment but higher value perception
- Common for premium apps

## 📊 Analytics Opportunities

With survey data, you can:

1. **Personalize onboarding**: Show relevant features first
2. **Segment users**: Target messaging by goals
3. **Optimize conversion**: A/B test survey questions
4. **Prioritize features**: Build what users want most
5. **Marketing insights**: Understand your audience

### Example Queries:

```sql
-- Most popular goal
SELECT primary_goal, COUNT(*)
FROM user_onboarding
GROUP BY primary_goal;

-- Conversion by reading frequency
SELECT
  reading_frequency,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN has_completed_onboarding THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as converted
FROM user_onboarding
GROUP BY reading_frequency;
```
